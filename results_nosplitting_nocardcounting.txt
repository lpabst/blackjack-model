The number of players in the match doesn't matter since each player plays directly against the dealer and that's it
    - I tried with different numbers of players and it's the same

Game Settings
{
    numberOfPlayers: 15,
    startingCashPerPlayer: 10000,
    numberOfDecks: 4,
    numberOfRounds: 20000,
    continuousShuffle: true,
    doubleDownIsAllowed: true,
    dealerHitsSoft17: true
}

Seems like the average result over 20,000 games ($10 bets) (no splitting & no card counting) is $10,000 => $5,862   
    - That's an average loss of about $0.2069 per game with a $10 bet = 2.069% loss rate

Average player cash after 20,000 rounds ($10 bets) - I average all 15 players for one total, so each of these 
numbers is a new game of 20,000 rounds with 15 new players

I found with 100,000 rounds the volatility goes away (seems more reliable). 
I also gave each player 100,000 to start 
Average loss of $20,800 = 2.08% loss rate (about the same as above)
